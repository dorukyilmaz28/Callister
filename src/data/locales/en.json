      "teamSize": "22 students and 1 mentor",
      "signature": "Best regards, Callister #9024 FRC Team",
      "paragraph1": "As the Callister #9024 FRC team, founded on May 19, 2022, we set out with the goal of training future leaders in science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) fields. With our strong team of 22 students and 1 mentor, we have made it our mission not only to build robots but also to contribute to society through social responsibility and awareness-focused projects. Each member of our team stands out not only with their technical competencies but also with their sensitivity, team spirit, entrepreneurship, and visionary approach.",
      "paragraph2": "Our mission is to inspire all segments of society as individuals who have internalized FIRST principles, to spread STEAM culture, and to lead others on this path. Our vision is to represent our country in the best way possible on national and international platforms, to contribute to both individual and social development, and to work for a sustainable world with projects that make a difference. In this direction, every work we carry out as a team is not just competition-focused but strategic steps aimed at creating a broader impact area.",
      "paragraph3": "With the projects we have implemented so far, we have inspired both children and adults. For example, within the scope of our \"Window\" project, we went to village schools and provided EV3 training. We enabled children to showcase not only their technical skills but also their creativity.",
      "paragraph4": "While highlighting the role of women in the art world with the \"Spirit of Women in Art\" webinar series, we also started a project this year to inspire girls. Within the scope of our collaboration with KEV, we held a seminar on May 13th with our \"Strong Women, Strong Tomorrows\" project; we brought young girls together with successful women in the business world. Thanks to this event, young girls had the opportunity to learn about different career fields and gained the opportunity to develop themselves and increase their motivation.",
      "paragraph5": "With our \"Turtle Museum\" project, we aimed to increase environmental awareness; we also opened an exhibition where we created works from recycled materials to raise awareness about the problems that turtles and other marine creatures face in their habitats in various schools. The purpose of our exhibition was to show what kind of waste exists in our seas, to create awareness against global warming, and to educate people.",
      "paragraph6": "As Callister, with our \"Save The Blue\" project, our team removed a ghost net from the sea in the Gulf of İzmit to reduce the damage that ghost nets cause to marine life and carried out underwater waste collection activities. Ghost nets cause marine creatures to get entangled and injured or die, damage underwater structures such as coral reefs, and cause microplastic pollution. With our work, we took a step towards protecting marine life and aimed to create environmental awareness. With this project, we contributed to the \"Ghost Nets\" project organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and Kocaeli Metropolitan Municipality.",
      "paragraph7": "With our project called \"Eco Footprint\", we drew attention to carbon footprint, strengthened both environmental awareness and social participation with beach cleaning events. Additionally, with projects such as the \"Mini Brick Symphony\" competition, \"Climate Museum\" project, \"New Access Icon\", we showed that we are active world citizens by addressing universal issues such as social justice, equality, environment, and sustainability. Our \"Ecoquake\" project, which we started to create earthquake awareness, is also one of the important steps we took to raise awareness in society.",
      "paragraph8": "We have always believed that the biggest impact we can create is to pass on what we know and our experiences to others correctly and powerfully. As Callister, we created an innovative website project to support young engineers and software developers. Our project \"FRC Academy\", which emerged from this thought, is actually a platform where all the knowledge and experiences our team has gained since May 19, 2022, come together. Within the scope of this project, we provided teams and students who are taking their first steps into the FRC world with the opportunity to develop their skills in design, software, mechanics, and electronics. As Callister, our goal is to pass on our experiences and draw the right path for those who come after us.",
      "paragraph9": "Many awards we have won:",
      "awardsList": [
        "Highest Rookie Seed Award",
        "Judges' Award",
        "Rookie Inspiration Award",
        "Rookie All-Star Award",
        "Gracious Professionalism Award"
      ],
      "paragraph10": "These awards show that we are not just a competitive team but an ecosystem that learns, teaches, and shares. As Callister, we aim to go beyond competition to solidarity, beyond learning to teaching, beyond success to creating impact.",
      "paragraph11": "While writing this letter, our desire was to explain that we are not just a competition team but also a transformation movement. With your company's support, we can reach bigger dreams together. Because we are a team that wants to design the future, questions boundaries, and works to change them."

In this project, which we undertook with the basic purpose of drawing attention to the sea turtle species under the threat of extinction and creating awareness, we explained in detail the measures to be taken and the road maps to be followed in our presentation, and as a result of this project, we created awareness among the students who came to our school."

We carried out a new one of our garbage collection events, which we made into a series, at İztuzu Beach. We collected most of the garbage that washed ashore.
